# Sanity.io docs

This used to be an app which served documentation pages. Not anymore. Now it's just a temporary repo to hold docs before we shuffle them into Gradient (via sanity-io-studio).


## Random notes

### Sanity Hosted is comprised of

- JS running on your laptop
- document cloud storage
- asset pipeline
